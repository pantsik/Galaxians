# Galaxians v.1.3
A space shooter 2D game

This is an arcade game made in Python by Panos and Giannis Tsikogiannopoulos with Turtle graphics library.

Shoot all the alien spaceships in each wave. There is a Boss Level after every 4 waves. If you destroy the Boss, a new alien species is coming to confront you. Can you kill them all?

Downloading instructions:

I had to remove the music score from the game in order to meet gitub's file size limitations. The sound effects are still there.

Download an unzip file Galaxians v1.3 nomusic.rar. It will create a folder named Galaxians and a file named Galaxians.bat. Double-click on Galaxians.bat. Enjoy!
